 This app was made with the instuction of Udacity in there IOS Development Course.
 If youre interested in being an IOS Dev I recommend the course
 
 Dont cheat and take my code. It will serve you no good and only put you farther behind. Swift is a very fun programming
 launguage to learn and has endless possibilities in custimization and App Architecture. If anyone has any recommendations to
 help the structure of my code or clean it up I would love to hear from you. Im always looking to grow and better my
 programming skills.
 
 Thank you for your time,
 
 Eli Warner
